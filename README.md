# Taskmaster
A web application developed during a group project assignment when studying at RMIT University between 2018 and 2021

# About
This was a university group project that was completed by several class members. It's a web application that was done as one of the final units
within the course as part of the bachelor degree. I have uploaded as a reference to a larger group project I have worked on in the past. For
more information, see the 'OriginalReadme' file which explains what Taskmaster aims to acheive.
