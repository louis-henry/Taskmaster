INTRODUCTION
------------

Welcome to Taskmaster, a project undertaken by a group of students studying at
RMIT University for the Programming Project unit. Taskmaster is a two way 
matchmaking system designed to connect those who need a task completed to
a willing participant for an exchange of value. Taskmaster aims to provide a 
simple yet effective communication medium to help both work providers and those
who seek to employ their skillsets.

PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING
-------------------------
 * Taskmaster is ready for use. We have implemented certain aspects that were not
   included in the original charter or plan, however, we feel that the future may
   allow us to further develope this site. For example, users have profiles with a 
   set picture. In the futurem, we may allow them to upload their own pictures.
   Another example is the Skills in Profile and Task pages showing a green bar. In
   the future, users may be able to set a proficiency level for this. It's important
   to note that features like this are not left unimplemented but rather, left for 
   the potential of future expansion. 

 * Taskmaster has been deployed on two different hosting links. Although unlikely, 
   one link may temporarily go down and in turn, we felt a second link may prove 
   useful as a redundancy. 
   
 * To reactivate an account, users must use the Contact Us form and submit to Admin.
   This action would be reviewed and manually confirmed by an Administrator. One reason
   is to help stop malicious users from operating if an account has been deactivated due 
   to nefarious purposes.
